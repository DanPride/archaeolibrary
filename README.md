Tel Gezer Flash and Php
This is a full source code public copy of an archaeology app.
The php is lamp php 4 and very primitive, as is the actionscript.
Both were my first efforts after only two month orientation to both technolgies.
Project Development was discontinued when efforts to get the baptist staff of the dig to turn on the camera
and properly document claims and finds with actual photographic provenance was declined.
The total absense of image data made the project irrelevant and futher development was discontinued.
