Tel Gezer Flash and Php
This is a full source code public copy of an archaeology app.
The php is lamp php 4 and very primitive, as is the actionscript.
A skeletal php5 object access to data is included along with an angularJS simple list object search.
Both were my first efforts after only a few months orientation to both technologies.
Project Development was discontinued when efforts to get the baptist staff of the dig to turn on the camera
and properly document claims and finds with actual photographic provenance was declined.
Despite repeated requests the dig steadfastly insisted on no shard level pics to document its stratigraphic claims.
The total absense of item level image data made the project irrelevant and futher development was discontinued.
Text data without validation was entered for another 8 years after suspension of development and Some objects and many field and locus photos were included
along with some copies of the square supervisor documents actually got uploaded.
